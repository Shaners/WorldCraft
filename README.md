WorldCraft
==========

Elements involved with procedural world creation.

### To Do:
* Lay out plans for this repo (goals, language)

####Stages of World Building:####
* Universe creation / physics generation
* Solar system generation
* Rocky-surface planet generation
* Climate generation
* Life generation
* Water biome generation
* Water animal generation
* Water ecology generation
* Land plant generation
* Land Biome generation
* Land animal generation
* Land ecology
* Disasters / Sweeping Changes

<sub>Generation = formation to ~homeostasis</sub> 

####Universe Creation / Physics Generation:####
* What is the sequence that created the universe?
* What are the rules of the universe (physics?)
* How old is the universe?

####Solar System Creation####
* Star generation
* Planet generation (force one to be habitable)
* How old is the solar system?

####Rocky-Surface Planet Generation####
* Planet structure generation
* Tectonic plate generation
* River generation
* Rock formations
* Erosion
* How old is the planet?

####Climate Generation####
* Atmosphere Generation
* Rate of radation absorbtion calculation
* Rain shadow calculation
* Seasons generation

####Life Generation####
* Where it began
* How it captured energy
* How it developed and adapted
* How it reproduces
* How it survived
* How it evolved

####Water Biome Generation####
* Ocean structure
* Ocean temperatures
* Photic zone
* Tides
* Sand and mud
* Continental shelves
* Black smokers

####Water Animal Generation####
* Sponge generation
* Coral, Jellyfish, Sea Anemonie generation
* Starfish, urchin generation
* Clam, snail, octpi generation
* Crustacea generation
* Backboned animals (fish) generation

####Water Ecology Generation####
* Establish balance between ocean elements
* Primary producers
* Primary consumers
* Secondary consumers

####Land Plant Generation####
* Liverworts
* Mosses
* Ferns
* Trees
* Grasses

####Land Biome Generation####
* Elevation and latitude
* Rainfall
* Temperature
* Seasons
* Micro climates

####Land Animal Generation####
* Reproduction
* Sunlight
* Gravity
* Air
* Sizes
* Foods

####Land Ecology Generation####
* Establish balance between land elements
* Primary producers
* Primary consumers
* Secondary consumers

####Disasters / Sweeping Changes####
* History of ecological disasters (ice ages, extinctions)
* Micro disasters

####Extra: Magic / Fantasy Elements####
* Creatures
* Materials
* etc
